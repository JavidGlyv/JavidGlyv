<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Javid</h1>

I am 22 years old Machine Learning practitioner based on Baku, Azerbaijan. Currently I am M.Sc. student in Data Science and AI at UFAZ (Strasbourg University (France) and ASOIU (Azerbaijan)).

I believe that machine learning can support any company in any area at any time.
